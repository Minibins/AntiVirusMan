    m_Localized: 'Dear Antivirusman fans! This is the last update in the 1.0 series.
      As you may have noticed, the game has a lot of bugs. Most of them are due to
      poor project architecture or actions that were not foreseen in Unity.

      I
      want to remake the project in Godot due to its advantages.

      

      And
      now to the list of changes.

      * We got rid of the Rainy Hearts font!

      *
      The database has been changed, descriptions for all viruses and upgrades have
      been added

      * Everyone who collected eggs can get a new upgrade: Easter
      eggs for dummies.

      * For those who have not collected them, there is
      an easter command, it is safe for progress.

      * Now the character''s
      characteristics are shown in the menu

      * The first 20 seconds of the
      game will only be green. After that, other viruses are gradually added. After
      5 minutes, the green ones are replaced by Blockerad.

      * Blockerad is
      a new virus that puts up a wall. Thanks for the idea Rob Demo.

      * The
      health and energy panel now has numbers.

      * Bugfixes, of course.

      *
      There is now a Watabell brickphone on the TV tower'
